# Ticket Cancellation Prediction

This project aims to predict ticket cancellation using machine learning. The model uses a dataset containing various attributes related to ticket cancellations, such as user information, trip details, and vehicle information.

## Data Processing
The data is preprocessed by removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. The preprocessing also includes scaling numerical features and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Building
The XGBoost classifier is used to build the predictive model. The model is trained on the training data and evaluated using the F1 score and classification report.

## Getting Started
To run the code and reproduce the results:
1. Install the required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost.
2. Download the dataset from the data folder.
3. Run the code to train the model and make predictions.

## Results
The model achieves an F1 score of [insert score here] on the test data. The classification report provides detailed performance metrics for the model.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict ticket cancellations based on various attributes. The trained model can be used to identify potential cancellations and take appropriate actions to minimize their impact.
